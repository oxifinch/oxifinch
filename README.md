## About me
Hello there! I'm a web developer and graduate from Glim√•kra Folkh√∂gskola in Sweden. I'm happiest when working on the back end with server-side applications, databases and technical problem solving, all the "dry" stuff that involves moving pieces of data around, and I feel most at home in a dark and cozy terminal on Linux. 

Before taking up programming, I worked with game development as a 3D graphics generalist, and took an interest in learning how to code after working close with some programmers on an indie game project.

In my free time, I'm either programming some more, writing sci-fi/fantasy novels about cowboy wizards and spaceships, playing tabletop RPGs as a Game Master, or taking long hikes out in the woods. 

### I'm currently learning
- Go
- HTMX
- SQL/SQLite

### What I'm working on
- [My exam project, budget-helper](https://github.com/oxifinch/budget-helper)
- My portfolio(this one right here!)

### My favorite tools
- Bash
- Vim
- ..pretty much anything that has to do with Linux, actually.
- Obsidian
