Hello there! I'm a web developer student and former game developer/3D graphics artist. 
I like to learn a little bit about everything there is to learn about programming, but I'm happiest when working on the back end with server-side applications, databases and technical problem solving. I'm also a huge GNU/Linux enthusiast, and you'll most likely find me hunched over a terminal when I'm working.

### I'm currently learning...
- Rust
- WebAssembly
- MongoDB
- Express
- Boostrap/SCSS

### What I'm working on
- [Skalver](https://github.com/oxifinch/skalver)
- [skalver-mdparser](https://github.com/oxifinch/skalver-mdparser)
- My portfolio(this one right here!)

### My favorite tools
- Bash
- Fish Shell
- Vim
- Vivaldi Browser
