Hello there! I'm a web developer student and former game developer/3D graphics artist. 
I like to learn a little bit about everything there is to learn about programming, but I'm happiest when working on the back end with server-side applications, databases and technical problem solving, all the "dry" stuff that involves moving pieces of data around.

### I'm currently learning...
- Go
- HTMX
- SQL/SQLite

### What I'm working on
- My portfolio(this one right here!)
- [My exam project, budget-helper](https://github.com/oxifinch/budget-helper)

### My favorite tools
- Bash
- Vim
- ..pretty much anything that has to do with Linux, actually.
- Obsidian
